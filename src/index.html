                I am an enthusiastic and determined individual with a strong passion for all things
                technology. Since my youth, I have been highly interested in computers, coding, and
                gaming and have also dreamed of a career in IT. As a student, I am seeking to build my
                work experience through a multitude of internships that will help me be a well rounded IT professional.
